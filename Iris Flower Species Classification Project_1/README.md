## Introduction
The **Iris dataset** is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning, originally introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end supervised learning pipeline**, from **data preprocessing** to **model training and evaluation**, in order to predict flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

---
## Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Build a **classification model** that accurately predicts the species of Iris flowers.
- Compare multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the most efficient one.
- Provide a **clean, reproducible pipeline** for educational and practical use.
